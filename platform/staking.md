# TrustWallet Staking Platform

In order to make TrustWallet the #1 staking platform in the world, we provide a
set of open source libraries and documentation to help blockchain developers to
integrate their staking solution. With TrustWallet, you'll have access to
millions of users to help you grow and secure your network.

## Talk about your implementation.

Create an issue in
[Trust Platform](https://github.com/trustwallet/platform/issues) describing your
project. Please fill the following questions before proceding with integration:

1. Is your staking on or off-chain?

   > If it's offchain, please describe how it's implemented

2. If it's on chain, is it implemented natively or using a smart contract?

   > Please describe all parameters required to build the message or call a
   > smart contract.

3. What are the staking rules of your blockchain?

   > Minimum value, locktime, lockout, etc.

4. Do you have any required step before staking? If yes, describe it.
   > Describe any required sep like token swap or balance freezing

## Return Staking Data

Trust Platform retrieve staking data from
[blockatlas](https://github.com/trustwallet/blockatlas). Blockatlas is used as a
common interface for querying data from different blockchains. To support
staking you have to implement the following interfaces:

````

### [Interface](https://github.com/trustwallet/blockatlas/blob/master/pkg/blockatlas/api.go)
```go
// StakingAPI provides staking information
type StakeAPI interface {
  Platform
  GetValidators() (ValidatorPage, error)
  GetDelegations(address string) (DelegationsPage, error)
}
````

To active Staking in your blockchain, imeplement the `StakeAPI` interface into
your blockchain API. eg: `blockatlas/platform/:blockchain/api.go`.
`GetValidators` method has to return the list of available validators and
`GetDelegations` should return the list of current delegations for a given
address. You can check the returned models by each method
[here](https://github.com/trustwallet/blockatlas/blob/master/pkg/blockatlas/staking.go).

Please follow
[tron](https://github.com/trustwallet/blockatlas/blob/master/platform/tron/api.go)
and
[cosmos](https://github.com/trustwallet/blockatlas/blob/master/platform/cosmos/api.go)
implementations for more details.

## Signing

If your blockchain implements staking natively, please describe all message
types required to `delegate`, `withdraw funds` then open a pull request to
[wallet-core](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core) project. You have to
include test cases with a correct message for each action.

If you blockchain uses a smart contract call on chain, please check if your
implementation in wallet-core supports smart contract call. Please create a
protobug message that encodes and simplifies the smart contract call. _Checkout
[tron TRC20](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/blob/master/src/proto/Tron.proto)
signing
[implementation](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/blob/master/src/Tron/Signer.cpp)
for example_. Include correct test cases for all call required to `delegate` and
`withdraw funds`.

If your blockchain uses an off-chain smart contract, eg ETH, please describe it
in your issue in Trust Platform with sample calls.

Include your blockchain into
[AnySigner](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/blob/master/src/Any/Signer.cpp)
class and add tests.

**Pull request without tests will be rejected.**

## RPC Endpoints

Please implement all RPC methods required for staking in your blockchain and add
them to [web-core rpc package](https://github.com/trustwallet/web-core):

Plese checkout
[cosmos](https://github.com/trustwallet/web-core/tree/master/packages/rpc/src/cosmos)
and
[tron](https://github.com/trustwallet/web-core/tree/master/packages/rpc/src/tron)
rpc implementations.

## Validators List

- Open a pull request to [trust assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)
  and add all validators that will be supported by TrustWallet.

  - Create a folder with the following format
    `/blockchains/<network_name>/validators` if one not yet not exist.
  - The folder should contain the following files and subfolders:
    ```
    .
    ├──blockchains/:blockchain:/validators
    |                           └──assets
    |                           |  └──<validator_address>
    |                           |      └──logo.png
    |                           |
    |                           └──list.json
    ```
  - Inside `assets` you have to add the logo for each supported validator, where
    `:validator:` is the the validator address.
  - The file `list.json` show following the format below:
    ```
      [
          {
              "id": string,
              "name": string,
              "description": string,
              "website": string
          }
      ]
    ```
  - You can find a sample
    [here](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/tree/master/blockchains/cosmos).

  * Minimum 3 validators required to support staking on TrustWallet platform.

After you finish your all 5 steps, please comment the issue on
[trust platform](https://github.com/trustwallet/platform) describing all steps
and their respective pull requests. Happy coding!

# CheckList

The above steps are summarized below as a checklist:

- [ ] Create an Issue describing your implementation in
      [trust platform](https://github.com/trustwallet/platform)
- [ ] Implement the required staking data in
      [blockatlas](https://github.com/trustwallet/blockatlas)
  - [ ] `GetValidators`
  - [ ] `GetDelegations`
- [ ] Implement the signing messages for all actions realted to satking in
      [wallet-core](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core). You have to
      adopt different strategies based on how staking is implemented in your
      blockchain:
  - [ ] **Native:** create the protobuf messages, implement the signing and add
        tests
  - [ ] **On chain smart contract call:** create the protobuf messages for the
        call and add tests
  - [ ] **Off chain smart contract call:** describe it with examples in your
        issue
- [ ] Implement RPC endpoints to communicate with nodes in your blockchain in
      [web-core](https://github.com/trustwallet/web-core) project.
  - [ ] Add unit and integration tests for all calls
- [ ] Create a validators list if necessary
- [ ] Comment your issue with references to all required pull requests.
